Class Notes
===========

I keep my class notes here.  For some reason.

I do notes in Org-Mode.  Not because of any massive love of Org Mode.  For
general writing, I prefer Markdown.  Org's main strength is (somewhat)
Markdown-esque syntax, but with LaTeX integration, and an admittedly sweet plain
text table mode.  Unfortunately, GitHub's org-mode rendering is pretty bad, and
doesn't bother with LaTeX at all.  And since it'd be nice for people to be able
to easily read my notes, I rolled up my sleeves and made Travis CI use emacs to
export the org to HTML.
